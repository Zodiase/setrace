Ever need to execute something AFTER "all images in a set have been loaded" or maybe when some other conditions are met? When asynchronous processes are involved, managing them gets complicated. This is a small library can be used to create a set of flags you want to monitor, and trigger the designated callback function when all flags are set. Now just create a set and send the flag setting interface to any asynchronous functions you want to call, and you can save your time writing the rest of the code!
